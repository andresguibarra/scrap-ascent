# Scrap Ascent

**Scrap Ascent** is a unique 2D platformer where you play as a mysterious Orb with the power to possess and control different types of robotic enemies. Use their unique abilities strategically to navigate challenging levels and overcome obstacles.

## üéÆ Game Concept

**Scrap Ascent** revolutionizes traditional platforming through its innovative possession-based gameplay. Rather than controlling a single character, you embody a mysterious Orb with the unique ability to take control of robotic enemies, each offering distinct capabilities and strategic applications.

### Core Innovation: Possession-Driven Gameplay
The fundamental mechanic centers around **strategic character switching**:
- **Dynamic Character Control**: Seamlessly transition between different robot types mid-gameplay
- **Ability-Based Problem Solving**: Each possession grants access to unique movement and combat capabilities  
- **Strategic Resource Management**: Choose the right enemy type for each challenge
- **Layered Complexity**: Simple possession mechanics combine to create sophisticated puzzle solutions

### Gameplay Pillars

**üîÑ Adaptive Possession System**
- **Proximity-Based Control**: Possess enemies within range through intuitive proximity detection
- **Visual State Management**: Clear color-coding system for instant enemy identification
- **Seamless Transitions**: Smooth character switching with momentum preservation
- **Strategic Depth**: Multiple solutions to challenges based on available enemy types

**‚ö° Physics-Enhanced Platforming**
- **Tier-Based Abilities**: Four distinct enemy tiers with progressive capability expansion
- **Advanced Movement**: Wall climbing, air dashing, double jumping, and precision platforming
- **Momentum Physics**: Realistic movement with coyote time, jump buffering, and air control
- **Environmental Interaction**: Physics-aware collision with dynamic platform systems

**üéØ Combat & Destruction**
- **Projectile Physics**: Armed enemies provide ranged combat with realistic trajectory calculation
- **Strategic Elimination**: Destroy enemy control chips to permanently disable threats
- **Weapon Management**: Auto-pickup systems with tactical weapon deployment
- **Environmental Combat**: Use projectiles to activate switches and solve ranged puzzles

**üß© Interactive Environmental Puzzles**
- **Multi-Component Systems**: Doors, buttons, platforms, and countdown mechanisms work in harmony
- **Cause-and-Effect Chains**: Actions create cascading effects throughout the environment
- **Timing-Based Challenges**: Countdown systems create urgency and strategic planning requirements
- **Spatial Reasoning**: 3D thinking in 2D space through layered puzzle design

### Unique Design Philosophy
Unlike traditional platformers where you master a single character's abilities, **Scrap Ascent** challenges you to:
- **Think Multi-Dimensionally**: Consider which enemy type best solves each specific challenge
- **Plan Possession Chains**: Sequence character switches to navigate complex areas
- **Adapt to Constraints**: Work with available enemy types when optimal choices aren't present
- **Master Multiple Skillsets**: Become proficient with different movement patterns and combat styles

This creates a gameplay experience where **strategic thinking** is as important as **mechanical skill**, and where the environment itself becomes a dynamic puzzle to solve through possession mastery.

## üéØ Gameplay Mechanics

### The Orb (Your Core Character)
- Small, nimble character that can move and jump
- Affected by gravity and physics
- **Primary Ability**: Possess nearby enemies within range

- Respawns when you release control from a possessed enemy

### Possession System
The heart of Scrap Ascent's gameplay:

1. **Possessing Enemies**: Get close to an enemy and press the possess key
2. **Taking Control**: The orb disappears and you gain full control of the enemy
3. **Using Abilities**: Access all of the possessed enemy's unique skills
4. **Releasing Control**: Press possess again to release control and respawn as the orb
5. **Strategic Switching**: Chain possessions to navigate complex areas

### Enemy States & Visual Indicators
- üî¥ **Red Tint**: AI-controlled enemy (can be possessed)
- üü¢ **Green Tint**: Currently controlled by you
- ‚ö´ **Gray Tint**: Inert/destroyed chip (cannot be possessed)

1. **Start as the Orb**: You begin as a small orb that can move and jump
2. **Find an Enemy**: Look for colored robots patrolling the platforms  
3. **Get Close**: Move within possession range (you'll see when you're close enough)
4. **Press K**: This possesses the nearest enemy - you'll see it turn green
5. **Experiment**: Try the enemy's abilities - movement feels different for each type
6. **Release Control**: Press K again to return to orb form

### Mastering Possession
- **Range Awareness**: Stay close to enemies you want to possess
- **Timing**: Possess enemies at the right moment to avoid hazards
- **Chain Possessions**: Move from enemy to enemy without returning to orb form

### Enemy Selection Strategy
- **Use Tier 1** for basic movement and when you need slow, precise control
