# Scrap Ascent

**Scrap Ascent** is a unique 2D platformer where you play as a mysterious Orb with the power to possess and control different types of robotic enemies. Use their unique abilities strategically to navigate challenging levels and overcome obstacles.

## üéÆ Game Concept

In Scrap Ascent, you don't play as a traditional hero. Instead, you are a small, ethereal Orb capable of taking control of enemy robots by possessing them. Each enemy type has different abilities, and mastering when and how to possess them is key to progressing through the game.

The core gameplay revolves around:
- **Possession Mechanics**: Take control of enemies to use their abilities
- **Strategic Ability Usage**: Different enemies have different movement and combat capabilities
- **Platforming Challenges**: Navigate levels using the right enemy for each obstacle
- **Combat System**: Armed enemies can shoot projectiles and engage in combat

## üéØ Gameplay Mechanics

### The Orb (Your Core Character)
- Small, nimble character that can move and jump
- Affected by gravity and physics
- **Primary Ability**: Possess nearby enemies within range
- Vulnerable but essential - losing the orb means game over
- Respawns when you release control from a possessed enemy

### Possession System
The heart of Scrap Ascent's gameplay:

1. **Possessing Enemies**: Get close to an enemy and press the possess key
2. **Taking Control**: The orb disappears and you gain full control of the enemy
3. **Using Abilities**: Access all of the possessed enemy's unique skills
4. **Releasing Control**: Press possess again to release control and respawn as the orb
5. **Strategic Switching**: Chain possessions to navigate complex areas

### Enemy States & Visual Indicators
- üî¥ **Red Tint**: AI-controlled enemy (can be possessed)
- üü¢ **Green Tint**: Currently controlled by you
- ‚ö´ **Gray Tint**: Inert/destroyed chip (cannot be possessed)

- Experiment with different enemies to find the best approach for each challenge

## üîß Weapon System

When controlling Armed Enemies, you gain access to a sophisticated weapon system:

### Weapon Mechanics
- **Shooting**: Projectiles travel in the direction you're facing
- **Cooldown**: Weapons have a fire rate limit to prevent spam
- **Knockback**: Weapons have recoil that can affect movement
- **Damage**: Projectiles can damage other enemies and destroy their control chips

### Weapon Management
- **Toggle**: Switch weapon on/off for different situations (C key handles both pickup and drop)
- **Pickup**: Weapons can be retrieved by pressing C when close to them

## üèóÔ∏è Interactive Environment

The world of Scrap Ascent features interactive elements that create dynamic puzzles and challenges:

### Doors
- **Animated Movement**: Doors open and close along predetermined paths
- **Trigger System**: Can be activated by buttons, switches, or other mechanisms
- **Crushing Mechanic**: Doors can destroy enemy control chips if they get caught while closing
- **Strategic Elements**: Use doors to block paths, access new areas, or disable enemies

### Pressure Buttons
- **Activation**: Step on buttons with any possessed enemy to activate them
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons light up and change color when activated
- **Persistent Activation**: Buttons stay active as long as an enemy remains on them
- **Door Control**: Many buttons are connected to doors for puzzle-solving gameplay
- **Strategic Use**: Use different enemy types to keep buttons pressed while accessing new areas

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- **Godot Engine 4.4** or later
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Minimum 2GB RAM
- Graphics card with OpenGL compatibility

### Running the Game

1. **Download Godot 4.4+**
   ```
   Download from: https://godotengine.org/download
   ```

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andresguibarra/scrap-ascent.git
   cd scrap-ascent
   ```

3. **Open in Godot**
   - Launch Godot Engine
   - Click "Import" and select the `project.godot` file
   - Click "Import & Edit"

4. **Run the Game**
   - Press **F5** or click the Play button
   - Select `TestingMechanics.tscn` as the main scene if prompted

### Troubleshooting
- **Game won't start**: Ensure you're using Godot 4.4 or later

## üéØ Gameplay Tips & Strategies

### Getting Started - First Steps
1. **Start as the Orb**: You begin as a small orb that can move and jump
2. **Find an Enemy**: Look for colored robots patrolling the platforms  
3. **Get Close**: Move within possession range (you'll see when you're close enough)
4. **Press K**: This possesses the nearest enemy - you'll see it turn green
5. **Experiment**: Try the enemy's abilities - movement feels different for each type
6. **Release Control**: Press K again to return to orb form

### Mastering Possession
- **Range Awareness**: Stay close to enemies you want to possess
- **Timing**: Possess enemies at the right moment to avoid hazards
- **Chain Possessions**: Move from enemy to enemy without returning to orb form

### Enemy Selection Strategy
- **Use Tier 1** for basic movement and when you need slow, precise control
- **Use Tier 2** for medium-range traversal, dash-based challenges, and wall climbing sections
- **Use Tier 3** for complex platforming requiring double jumps, agility, and advanced wall climbing
- **Use Armed Enemies** for combat situations and destroying obstacles

### Advanced Techniques
- **Momentum Preservation**: Your velocity carries over when releasing control
- **Ability Chaining**: Combine different enemy abilities by possessing sequentially
- **Combat Tactics**: Use armed enemies to clear paths and disable other enemies
- **Wall Climbing**: Use Tier 2 and 3 enemies to slide down walls and perform wall jumps for vertical navigation
- **Environmental Puzzles**: Use possessed enemies to activate buttons and manipulate doors for level progression
